Dear Festival Organizer,

I am writing to **express my gratitude** for the **fantastic** jazz festival held at Central Park this year. As an  **annual attendee** , I must say that this year’s event **exceeded all expectations.** The performances were  **exquisite** , and the **vibrant** **atmosphere** truly **brought the community together.**

However, I noticed a **significant** issue that impacted attendees  **with disabilities** . While walking to the main stage, I encountered a man in a wheelchair **struggling to find** handicapped parking nearby. Unfortunately, he had to **leave** after spending over 30 minutes in freezing -10°C weather  **without success** . **This situation could have been avoided with better planning.**

To **address** this, I suggest **designating** a few handicapped parking spaces closer to the main stage. Additionally, **clear signage indicating** the locations of key facilities such as parking, restrooms, and vendor areas would greatly **enhance the overall accessibility of the event.**

Thank you once again for organizing such an **outstanding** festival. I hope that with these  **adjustments** , next year’s event will be even more **inclusive** and **enjoyable** for all attendees.

Warm regards,

Smars

精听笔记如下：

<code>A family driving near Banff, British Columbia, on the camping trip last weekend, narrowly avoided crashing into a deer. only to hit a large fenson(pheasant) instead.</code>

<code>Banff is a nature reserve, home to thousands of wild animals, including bears, deer, and ???(countless game) birds such as pheasant.</code>

<code>Michael Jenson, who was driving at the time, said they were heading back to their campsite around dusk,  when they came around a bend of the highway, and saw a deer, trying to trotting across the road, Jenson s???(swerved) succssfully around the animal, but only a few seconds later, a pheasant flew across the road, in the opposite direction, and hit the windshield. He pulled over to the side of the road, as the deer ran into the forest, unharmed. Unfortunately, for the pheasant, the impact of windshield, killed it immediately. However, Jenson's daughter Emily, who took a wilderness survival course last year, decided to make the best of the situation, she took the bird back to the campsite, and roasted it with garlic and onions, it's completely legal to eat roadkill in the British Columbia, she explained. why waste perfect good food?  it's sad that we hit it, but at least it didn't go to waste.</code>

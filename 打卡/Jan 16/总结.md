Task1 ：

关于一个活动没有给残疾人规划停车区域的 建议信 （打分7分） 但是学到很多优秀的表达，可以试着总结出一套模板来。下面是12分的改写后范文：

Dear Festival Organizer,

I am writing to **express my gratitude** for the **fantastic** jazz festival held at Central Park this year. As an  **annual attendee** , I must say that this year’s event **exceeded all expectations.** The performances were  **exquisite** , and the **vibrant** **atmosphere** truly **brought the community together.**

However, I noticed a **significant** issue that impacted attendees  **with disabilities** . While walking to the main stage, I encountered a man in a wheelchair **struggling to find** handicapped parking nearby. Unfortunately, he had to **leave** after spending over 30 minutes in freezing -10°C weather  **without success** . **This situation could have been avoided with better planning.**

To **address** this, I suggest **designating** a few handicapped parking spaces closer to the main stage. Additionally, **clear signage indicating** the locations of key facilities such as parking, restrooms, and vendor areas would greatly **enhance the overall accessibility of the event.**

Thank you once again for organizing such an **outstanding** festival. I hope that with these  **adjustments** , next year’s event will be even more **inclusive** and **enjoyable** for all attendees.

Warm regards,

Smars

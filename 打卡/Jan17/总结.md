Task2 ：

关于学校征求家长意见：有孩子对食物过敏，是组织学生做过敏源测试，还是让家长自己去带饭。

下面是12分的改写后范文：

I strongly believe that the school should conduct allergy testing for all children rather than requiring them to bring their own lunch. The long term benefits it offers far outweighs the cost it may save if they bring their own lunch to the school.

Firstly, allergy testing helps both parents and schools to better understand children’s health conditions. By identifying specific allergens, parents can prepare meals that cater to their child’s needs, such as gluten-free or nut-free options. This proactive measure promotes the well-being of children and prevents potential allergic reactions.

Secondly, implementing allergy testing encourages the school to improve its meal services. With comprehensive knowledge of students’ allergies, the school can diversify its food offerings to accommodate everyone. Providing safe and nutritious meals is an essential part of the school’s responsibility in fostering students’ well-being.

In conclusion, conducting allergy testing is a crucial step to ensure children’s health and safety. It benefits not only individual students but also elevates the overall quality of the school’s lunch program.

Well, thanks for being on time, folks. Our agenda today is pretty short: We’re just trying to decide on the venue for our company’s **20th** anniversary celebration. Any ideas?

I’ve got a couple of places in mind. One’s smaller and one’s larger. It depends how many people we’re talking about. How many are coming?

Well, we’re up to a hundred maximum. Everyone’s allowed to **invite** their spouse or partner. Here’s the program as we know it: Starting at 7:00 p.m. wine, speeches, and maybe **award** presentations, followed at 8:00 p.m. by a **buffet** dinner. Starting at 9:30, there’ll be entertainment . . . ideally, **a live band**, if we can afford one.

> up to 200 people, that's quite crowd, we always need space for everyone, but we don't wanna go over the budget, 

Up to a hundred people . . . That’s quite a crowd. **Obviously**, we need space for everyone, but we don’t want to go over budget.

Well, I have got a few **penny-pinching** tricks up my sleeve. We could find a venue on a weekday . . . Monday **through** Thursday is cheaper. We can also find a place that’s out of town. Maybe even out in the suburbs. And, **if worse comes to worst**, **we could always hire a DJ instead of a live band.**

> also, we don't want to need to go over band of menu, we can just order some reasonably price food that everyone will enjoy.

Also, we don’t need to go **overboard** on the menu. We could just order reasonably priced food that everyone will enjoy.

And we can always tweak the menu a bit, assuming the **caterer** will let us.

Yeah, I know a place called Griffin's that might be perfect. It’s in Wimberton

About 30 minutes east by car on Highway **18**. Anyway, Griffin's is family owned, has great ambience, and **fairly** reasonable prices. **They do group** bookings as well. I know the manager. I might be able to talk him **into giving** us a discount.

> my main concern would be the location. my brother retired and moved to winberton, it's impossible to get there by public transit, you know, we don't want to see for a while to people getting behind the will after we had a few drinks.  you know, we wanna get them all take ? and then we have to reimburse them for the ride.

Yeah, my concern would be the location. My brother retired and moved to Wimberton, and it’s impossible to get there by public transit. You know, we don’t want to say **farewell** to people as they’re **getting behind the wheel** after a few drinks. You know, we’d want to get them all to **take taxis home**, and then we’d have to **reimburse** them for the ride.

> we don't encourage that expense, ... here, chinks?

We don’t want to incur that expense! **Ditto here. Jinx!**

Hey, how about The Red Door? It’s just two blocks north of here. It’s right on the subway line. I know their dining area seats over a hundred people. I’m pretty sure the owner can accommodate us **price-wise** . . . and he just hired the top chef in the city.

> sounds well, we will be checking it out. bryan, could u please contact the manager to get next submit? oh, better yet, get two, one for thursday, one for saturday, so we will meet next week, we'll take from there.
